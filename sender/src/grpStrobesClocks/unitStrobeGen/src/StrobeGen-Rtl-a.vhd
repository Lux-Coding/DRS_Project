-- Description : Generates a strobe signal that will be '1' for one cycle of
--               iClk. The strobe comes every gStrobeCycleTime. If this cycle
--               time cannot be generated exactly, it will be truncated to
--               the accuracy of one iClk cycle.

architecture Rtl of StrobeGen is

  -- How many iClk cycles make up one strobe cycle?
  -- Not as easy as it looks at first glance! The result will tend to be to small,
  -- because we only integer divide here. A remainder other than 0 will typically result.
  -- Example:
  -- Generate a 6 MHz strobe from a 48 MHz iClk.
  -- 48E6/6E6=8, but consider the very similar equation 48E6/(6E6+1)=7!
  -- Example:
  -- Generate the strobe that comes closest to 44100 kHz (audio CD sampling rate) from
  -- a 48 MHz iClk.
  -- 48E6/44110=1088, (keep in mind that 48E6/44118 would be 1087 already).
  -- The choosen value (i.e. 1088) will lead to a slightly higher frequency
  -- of 44117.65 Hz.
